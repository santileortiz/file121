This is a list of test cases we should handle when implementin real tests

Uploading:
  - Upload file/directory
      /testdir/file1 -> /testdir/file1
      /testdir/directory1/ -> /testdir/directory1/

  - Upload deep directory

  - Upload file/directory and rename
      /testdir/file1 -> /testdir/renamed_file1
      /testdir/directory1/ -> /testdir/renamed_directory1/

  - Fail to upload existing directory/file
      /testdir/file1 -> /testdir/file1
      /testdir/directory1/ -> /testdir/directory1/

Bindings:
  - Any binding that ends up with the same direcctory in 2 different places
    upstream should be forbidden.

    Local
    base/
     bound/
      boundsubdir/
     dir/
      subdir
      file

    Upstream
    base/
     dir/
      subdir/
      file
      bound/
       boundsubdir/

    The binding local:/base/bound/boundsubdir -> upstream:/base/dir/boundsubdir
    is invalid because it would make it ambiguous where to place boundsubdir
    upstream. It could be either at upstream:/base/dir/boundsubdir or
    upstream:/base/bound/boundsubdir

    I'm still not 100% clear on what are the minimal conditions to decide an
    invalid binding.

  - Create a binding for an existing local directory. Should trigger upload of
    that directory to the appropriate place. As long as the directory doesn't
    exist upstream. If the locally bound directory is part of a subtree that's
    already uploaded, fail.
